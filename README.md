# Hi there, I'm Madeleine! 👋

## I'm a junior web developer currently based in Adelaide, Australia. 👩‍💻


🌱 I am currently studying web devlopement through a coding bootcamp at the University of Adelaide.

✈️ I spent the last decade travelling around the world, settling in Austin, Texas then Manchester (UK) before finally moving back to Australia in 2020.

 💻 I have always been fascinated with technology, programming and design but it wasnt until I spent 5 months in lockdown in the UK that I decided to delve into this head on!
 
🛠️ I am still a relatively new web developer but I have picked up some lifelong skills and am looking forward to whath the future holds!

⚡ Fun fact: Im a walking encylopeadia of book, film and tv knowledge! Ask me anything! 📖 🎞️
